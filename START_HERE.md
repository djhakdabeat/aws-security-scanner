## 🚀 What It Does

### Security Checks Performed

| Resource | Checks | Severity |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **S3 Buckets** | Public access, ACL permissions | CRITICAL/HIGH |
| **Security Groups** | Open ports, 0.0.0.0/0 rules | CRITICAL/HIGH |
| **IAM Users** | MFA status, key age | MEDIUM |
| **RDS Databases** | Public access, encryption | HIGH/MEDIUM |

### Sample Output

```bash
$ python aws_security_scanner.py

================================================================================
AWS SECURITY VULNERABILITY SCANNER
================================================================================

[*] Scanning S3 Buckets...
  [!!] CRITICAL: Bucket my-data-bucket is publicly accessible!

[*] Scanning Security Groups...
  [!] web-sg: Port 22 open to internet

[*] Scanning IAM Users...
  [!] admin-user: Access key is 120 days old
  [!] developer: MFA not enabled

[*] Scanning RDS Instances...
  [!] production-db: Publicly accessible!

================================================================================
AWS SECURITY SCAN REPORT
================================================================================
Total Vulnerabilities Found: 5

CRITICAL: 1
